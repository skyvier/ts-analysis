Module      : Regression
Description : Regression analysis
Maintainer  : joonas.laukka@aalto.fi
Stability   : in development

The module implements some basic regression analysis
methods such as least squares. Some important values about
that the estimate are stored in the Plot data type automatically.

--   most popular types of dependence.

   , xs :: Matrix a               -- ^ The independent variable data matrix
   } deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Plot contains information about a regression estimate.
data Plot a = Plot 
   { coefs :: Matrix a           -- ^ Estimate coefficients
   , values :: Matrix a          -- ^ Estimated values for the given predictor values
   , residuals :: Matrix a       -- ^ Estimation residuals

   , base :: Base a              -- ^ The measured base for the regression
   } deriving Eq

-- * Instances

-- | Show instance for plot.
